### Incompatibility

To support more `rich_text` block elements, we had to introduce some breaking changes to the JSON parser by https://github.com/seratch/jslack/pull/269

* Rename `GsonRichTextSectionElementFactory` to `GsonRichTextElementFactory`
* Extract `RichTextSectionElement.Element` as `RichTextElement`

`Attachment#metadata` used to be string type but it was wrong. https://github.com/seratch/jslack/pull/270 changed the field to be correct.
