## version 3.3.0 (2019-12-18)

* f25ccf7 Add query string support in Lightning web endpoints by Kazuhiro Sera
* 7dc814c Change Lightning implementation to use only auth.test by Kazuhiro Sera

* a395d7c Add six admin APIs by Kazuhiro Sera
* 9242528 Commonize response_metadata holding message strings for error patterns by Kazuhiro Sera

### Incompatibility

There are two minor breaking changes since version 3.2.x series. Java compiler detects all of them but it would be appreciated if you could understand the decisions.

#### ErrorResponseMetadata

https://github.com/seratch/jslack/commit/92425282a9dc4f2cbb444b43246b4f8b11b2bbed

To commonize `response_metadata` containing `messages` in responses, `com.github.seratch.jslack.api.model.ErrorResponseMetadata` class has been introduced. The following classes have been modified to use the new class instead of their inner classes.

* AdminTeamsCreateResponse
* AdminUsersAssignResponse
* AdminUsersInviteResponse
* AdminUsersRemoveResponse
* AdminUsersSetAdminResponse
* AdminUsersSetOwnerResponse
* AdminUsersSetRegularResponse
* ChatPostMessageResponse
* PinsAddResponse
* ViewsOpenResponse
* ViewsPublishResponse
* ViewsPushResponse
* ViewsUpdateResponse

#### Re-packaging admin APIs

https://github.com/seratch/jslack/commit/a395d7c8408082bc08363de7f4ccf5402b33ea42

* AdminTeamsOwnersListRequest/Response from `admin.teams` to `admin.teams.owners`
* AdminTeamsSettingsSetDescriptionRequest/Response from `admin.teams` to `admin.teams.settings`
* AdminTeamsSettingsSetIconRequest/Response from `admin.teams` to `admin.teams.settings`

## version 3.2.5 (2019-12-11)

* ace41ea #301 Fix a bug where url_verification doesn't work without bot token by Joel McCance

## version 3.2.4 (2019-12-11)

* 929333a Fix #298 Add RichTextSectionElement.Color by Kazuhiro Sera

* f9c4944 Fix #293 SlackApiException and other exceptions are not standard by Kazuhiro Sera

## version 3.2.2 (2019-12-04)

* 182c3bc Add oauth.v2.access error handler by Kazuhiro Sera
* ac1a386 Bump jetty-server version to the latest minor by Kazuhiro Sera

## version 3.2.1 (2019-11-30)

* 2b6939c Expose the methods to run api calls etc by Kazuhiro Sera

## version 3.2.0 (2019-11-29)

* 9cd119b Handle message-related events appropriately (breaking change) by Kazuhiro Sera
* 9e89bac Add admin.teams.settings.* endpoints by Kazuhiro Sera
* a8137f8 Run tests with the latest APIs by Kazuhiro Sera

### Incompatibility

* Only newly posted messages are recognized as `MessageEvent`
* Other events having `subtype` (`bot_message`, `message_changed`, `message_deleted`, `thread_broadcast`, `ekm_access_denied`, and `me_message`) are no longer available as `MessageEvent`. They have corresponding classes (e.g., `MessageBotEvent`)

For example, if you have `EventHandler`/`LightningEventHandler` handling `MessageEvent` and expect the code to receive `bot_message` events as `MessageEvent`, the code requires changes to have a `MessageBotEvent` handler for `bot_message` events.

* c7647a5 Fix #264 Unknown RichTextSectionElement type: broadcast by Kazuhiro Sera

### Incompatibility

* Rename `GsonRichTextSectionElementFactory` to `GsonRichTextElementFactory`
* Extract `RichTextSectionElement.Element` as `RichTextElement`

`Attachment#metadata` used to be string type but it was wrong. https://github.com/seratch/jslack/pull/270 changed the field to be correct.
